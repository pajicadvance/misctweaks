# MiscTweaks

This is a lightweight mod that adds a few QoL features and addresses some gameplay annoyances.

Server-side:
- Creeper explosions drop all destroyed items instead of only some of them
- Berry bushes don't do any damage when sneaking or wearing leg or body armor
- Berry bushes don't slow down entities as much when wearing leg or body armor
- Cobwebs can be set on fire and burned. Blocks from other mods can be added to the configuration for mod compatibility
- Flying into water with the Elytra makes the player start swimming instead of continuing to fly underwater
- Thorns and Soul Speed don't cause durability damage to armor
- Mining obsidian-like blocks takes less time (1.6x faster by default). Blocks from other mods can be added to the configuration for mod compatibility
- Stable block drops - Disables the random horizontal movement that block drops get when breaking blocks. Crouching while breaking a block near you will make its drops fling towards you
- Any music disc dropped by creepers can be found in loot chests instead of only 13 or Cat
- Animals search for food items dropped on the ground near them and eat it on their own
- Backported lodestone changes from 1.21.5
- Backported saddle recipe and loot changes from 1.21.6
- (Disabled by default) Vanilla saplings can grow tree variants added by other mods. Requires manual configuration, default configuration includes vanilla trees and an example configuration for [Geophilic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/geophilic)
- (Disabled by default) Shulkers don't duplicate when hit by shulker bullets

Client-side:
- Per-dimension brightness - Change brightness for each dimension individually
- Hotbar is raised from the bottom of the screen (by 2 pixels by default). Supports UI resource packs. Automatically disabled if [Raised](https://modrinth.com/mod/raised) is installed
- Shield is lowered (but still visible) when held in offhand. Modded shield items can be added to the config for mod compatibility

Tweaks can be toggled on/off and configured. On Fabric, access the in-game config via [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu). On NeoForge, access the in-game config via the built-in mod menu. If [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) is installed, most client-side features can be configured in Sodium video settings.

All versions require [Fzzy Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/fzzy-config). Fabric version also requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
